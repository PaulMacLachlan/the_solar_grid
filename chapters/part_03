Notes:
Listening back to PT3 demos, writing, moving so I'll be making notes and observations and writing until I get settled in the new space.

COVID-19 / POST STUDIO MOVE UPDATES:

After (thankfully) relocating the studio from DTLA, and life / other projects taking up a considerable amount of my time, AND the COVID-19 quarantine shaking things up quite a bit, I'm finally back to working on chapter 3.

I've had most of pt 3 roughed out for some time, but I've had a hard time with the final scene, where our heroine who's posting in the streets of flooded Cairo gets accosted by not just "Bill Paxton" (SEE: the Terminator - Opening scene) but then the filthy cop.
about 2 weeks ago, after a phone call with Ganzy to welcome Mounir to the family, I began again in earnest, as I started to get my music mojo back about a month or so ago, and had been primarily focused on a "new" N/A song, tentatively titled *the Bridge*.
So, I took some time away from that to try again with this scene. The really tricky part for me is the ambience. You see, in a normal city, in todays reality, at night, you'd expect some talking, maybe some sirens, some music from a car or two here or there, but now the city is flooded, so any real traffic is going to be by boat.
not too many pedestrians if you know what I mean, plus its late at night, so how do you place the listener into a location which doesn't exist, using only sounds they are familiar with, and not relying on visuals from the book that they may or may not reference?
