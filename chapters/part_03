Notes:
Listening back to PT3 demos, writing, moving so I'll be making notes and observations and writing until I get settled in the new space.

COVID-19 / POST STUDIO MOVE UPDATES:

After (thankfully) relocating the studio from DTLA, and life / other projects taking up a considerable amount of my time, AND the COVID-19 quarantine shaking things up quite a bit, I'm finally back to working on chapter 3.
