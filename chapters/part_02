6/10/2019 - 6/19/2019
Notes:(missed a couple of updates here, backfilling)
â€¢Â prepped and mixed "Investigation Scene"
â€¢ prepped stems for "Cox News Intro"
â€¢ hit a little bit of trouble with PT>Ableton Rewire and playback glitchy-ness
while trying to export stems to PT. I believe I worked most of it out
and can print the stems proper today or tomorrow.

<<< took an artists retreat to the coast to clear my head >>>

6/25/2019
Notes:
â€¢ Got Stems from News track imported into PT, working on organization
â€¢ Not satisfied with News Intro Mix, difficult to find a valid reference track.
Going to let this breathe and come back to it

7/2/2019
Notes:
â€¢ Prolly got wrapped up a bit on IG trying to do some stories on the mix, but
broke out stems for Interview scene and got a solid rough going. Coming back
today to finalize and move on to the next.

7/3/2019
Notes:
â€¢ Wrapped up the "interview" scene mix this today, (was "wrapped" last night but
 added a little sugar after listening again this morning)
â€¢ setting up to run the stems for the Trip to SkyQuench scene today
â€¢ have a rough of the Skyquench track to reference over the next few days

7/12/2019
Notes:
â€¢ Mixes for all cues have been completed.
â€¢ Because I have the time, I'm going back through the sessions front to back,
now that I've mixed the entirety of Part 02, and can hear all the tracks in
context and making subtle adjustments with the whole piece in mind.
â€¢ Turns out the "News Intro" piece that I was unhappy with a few weeks ago
sounds pretty decent after all, there's just a flow to the timing that feels
organic, and isn't tied to a tight grid, and I think thats awesome, but a bit
scary to my ears all at once. Leaving it in just as a part of the process.
â€¢ There is one last bit that is entirely SFX that I need to address, that
happens just before the News Intro. Have family visiting this weekend but may
have a chance to address this while they're here.

7/24/2019
Notes:
â€¢Â TSG Part 02 Soundscape is COMPLETED.
â€¢ I messaged Ganzeer the preview link, and he gave his approval of the final a
few days ago. Something to the effect of:

"Fuckin. A, my man
My favorites are the detective sequence and the TV one
Brrriiiillliant, dude
ðŸ”¥"

I think we're off to a good start!
â€¢Â I of course have a LOOOOOT of work to do still:
Prepping for streaming services mainly:
â€¢ Soundcloud
â€¢ Spotify
â€¢ Apple Music
â€¢ Bandcamp

And my personal fav, the Soundscape vid for YouTube.
â€¢Â I hesitated last time around in dealing with the major streaming services,
mostly due to the up front investment (pay to play) for the streaming services.
At present, I think it costs me $45 a year to host a single EP on the services.

UPDATE:
I'm considering removing my last, "traditional" N SLASH A release, "EP 1" from
the services and relegating it to SoundCloud and other free services for now at
least, so that I can focus on NEW MATERIAL. Those songs are great and I love
them, but maybe its time to move on and put me eyes forward.


7/30/2019
Notes:
I've spent the last few days updating graphics and such for the release of
Part 2, received another confidence-boosting critique of Part 2 from my best
friend Lucas, who insists the release is good to go.

I also have been now able to compare Part 1 to Part 2, and the level of P1 is
considerably louder as I mastered it at about ~3 dB louder for YouTube, knowing
they wouldnt mess with the level much if at all, but this new release sounds
better these 3 dB lower, and I think I'll need to quickly address that in the
master of Part 1 and re-publish it (another reason why its awesome I havent
messed with the streaming services/tunecore yet, cause dropping an update to
that file could be a real PITA with them)
