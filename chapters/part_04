UPDATE:
Whoah... I've written and rewritten this chapter I think 3 times now... The last 2 years have been understandably difficult, but over the last 2 months, I've finally been able to make some progress with this chapter I'm really satisfied with.
Broken into 5 scenes, I'm wrapping writing on SN 3 & 4 and putting final touches on the intro, and the rest of the scenes.

Had a call w G to catch up on a few details of "the nightmare scene" I wasnt sure about, and can press forward wrapping that scene up.

Good things...

UPDATE:
Finished up the Nightmare Sequence today... really happy with that one, got to stretch my wings quite a bit. all thats left is the brief scene with Algebri and Professor Chaska and thats a wrap on PT4.

UPDATE:
Went back to sweeten up the flute melody in the end of the scene with Kovsky and Mehrets auntie (cant recall her name ATM) and also tried adding some "grisly bits" to the shooting sequence in the nightmare... but damn if thats almost WORSE without the visuals... not sure if I'll keep that or not.

And began the final section yesterday, the scene after the cafe where Prof Chaska punches that dudebro, *before* he gets shot... I have a nice piece of music there, kinda upbeat but with a semi solemn vibe... I want them to be enjoying each others company and having a good convo, before the shit goes down - however, this is a flashback/nightmare, so a bittersweetness will help add to the vibes after multiple listens and one truly understands the nature of the scene, or at least how I interpret it.
