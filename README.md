# What is The Solar Grid Soundscape?

A few years ago, Ganzeer asked me to help him create some music for a trailer that would be for his upcoming graphic novel, "The Solar Grid". Of course I said HELL YES. The rest is history.

After a handful of conversations and demos, I arrived at what I felt was the best way one could "describe" what it would sound like in this work that Ganzeer had created: Creating 15-20 minute blocks of music, one per chapter (nine in total) complete with sound effects and other audio textures of the world, that would serve as a supplement to the story and hopefully add another layer of depth to the already engrossing story.

I've completed 2 chapters worth of material so far, and more are on the way: https://nslasha.bandcamp.com/releases

# What is the purpose of this repository?

To leverage the tools that I know from software development - in this case, GIT - to create a journal of sorts for the work associated with crafting this soundtrack.

After nearly two years of writing/recording and mixing, I thought it might be great to document the steps I'm taking to flesh this score out. Partially for historical purposes, and partially for documentation purposes (and a little bit for time management.)

More soon, thanks!
