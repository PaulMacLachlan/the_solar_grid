# The Solar Grid Soundscapes
WIP - findings and process documentation and general information for the Solar Grid Soundscapes.

I'm trying something new here: To leverage the tools that I know from software development - in this case, GIT - to create a journal of sorts for the work associated with crafting this "soundtrack".

After nearly two years of writing/recording and mixing, I thought it might be great to document the steps I'm taking to flesh this score out. Partially for historical purposes, and partially for documentation purposes (and a little bit for time management.)

while I'm getting started fleshing this repo out, heres two bits you can check out:
